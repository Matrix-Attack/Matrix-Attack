# Matrix-Attack
A PC puzzle game from around the year 2000




# History

Note that I did NOT create any of this content.

Matrix Attack was developed by a team of students at DigiPen in the late 1990s.

I knew some of these developers at the time, and I was in the process of teaching myself computer game programming.

To assist, one of the provided me this source code to study so I could learn more about timer control and user inputs in video games.

From this, I later made a clone known as Matrix Advance as a homebrew game for the Nintendo Gameboy Advance.

This game, in binary form, used to be available on DigiPen's web site. However, it appears that all pre-2008 content has since been deleted.

The downloads for this game also appear to be missing from the Internet Archive.

Knowing that my Matrix Advance game was a clone of Matrix Attack, there have been asks online for the original PC game if anyone had a copy.

Well, it turns out I still have that, along with all of the original, unmodified source code!

I'm publishing all of that content here now for anyone else that wishes to learn from late 90's style game programming in OpenGL and DirectDraw.




# Random Thoughts

One of the songs has the sound byte "Bruce You Lost Me" - Doug, the music composer once told me that this was an inside joke in a particular class.

The instructor's name was "Bruce", and would apparently explain things either too fast or confusingly to the students, and so someone would interject
with "Bruce, you lost me!"
