**** VERSION 1.22 ****
	GamePlay:
	   - Added a little treat if you reach 25,000 points in time trial. ( VERY HARD TO DO ) I havn't
		been able to do it ever since the new score table.

	   - Added a version information in the Titlescreen.
	
	   - Fixed the frame rate problem in DirectDraw Fullscreen mode. The flip() function was suckin'.
		Switched that bad boy over to blit()... much better. Wise man once say, 75fps is better than 30fps.

	   - Yet more fixes with time and gameplay. On other machines, ones that skip allot with cpu time,
		I noticed that it affected switching gems.. as well as the buttons and the cursor. So I fixed it.

	   - Tweaked the score again. This time Streaks are worth more when you reach higher levels, but
		worth less per cluster. Im trying to make 10,000pts the score everyone wants. Of course
		once you get that you should be able to go allot higher with your MA skills.

	   - There was a bug in counting the number of combos and linkers... can't belive this slipped 
		through... anyway, the score is fixed again.
	Art:
	   - Found a pixel that was floating in the middle of some art.. so i took that one pixel out.. heh.

**** VERSION 1.21 ****
	GamePlay:
	   - Fixed the resetting of the background colors in Time Trial mode. Doh! its my fault for 
		coding all night and missing this. -Eli

	   - Put Camera mode back in.

	   - I felt that streaks were not rewarding enough so I added a streak point table, 
		so when the announcer says something you know you got some points. 

	   - Fixed a bug in the menu when you press ESC while entering the character password.

	   - Made buttons enable and disable based on time rather than updates. 
		(what were we thinking back then? -eli )

	   - Added a link to Doug Quinn's website. He did the music and allot of people were wanting
		to know more about this programmer/musician. "www.mp3.com/DougNoTronik"

**** VERSION 1.2e ****
	
	Sound and Music:
	   - Made music goto the next track in the list when it finishes playing the current track.

	   - Added "New Song?" menu option that will play the next song in the song list.

	   - Added hot keys (F1 and F2) for Next song and Previous song.

	   - Added .mp3 file drop in support. 
		 (Now you can listen to your favorite music while playing matrix attack!
		  Just put the .mp3 files you want to listen to in the Music folder )
	
	GamePlay:
	   - Added a new feature -> STREAKS!!!! 
			Read the readme.txt for an explanation of this SWEET new feature!

	   - Added different colored backgrounds. In Time Trial when your points reach a certain point
		the background will change color. (kind of like tetris) In puzzle mode its just random.

	   - Added a SWITCHER dot icons that appears when you press ENTER to switch. This is to help
		the user understand what gems you can switch with, and what gems you cannot.

	   - Wrote new instructions, hopefully people will understand these instructions better.

	   - Tweaked the Point table AGAIN. This time streaks help more and combos help less.

	   - Made sure the random gems that initially appear on the "active" side didn't
		already match up to form clusters. Heh we didn't check that before so some
		people were given free clusters. Note: not doing this on the "passive" side.

	   - The time taken for Flips have been increased to match switches.

	   - The ESC key FINNALY takes you back a menu or out of the game rather than just
		  quits the whole game.

	   - Re arranged some of the puzzles so they seem more "in order".
	      That infinity puzzle was way too early in the mix.

	   - Added another puzzle that eases people into the passive side concept.

	   - Made the puzzle startup text stay on for a longer period of time. (now you can read it)

	   - Put "Real" code words in the puzzle code list. 
	      Before it was PUZZLEXX where XX == puzzle number.
	      (you can still type in PUZZLEXX to warp to a puzzle though - developer secret revealed!)
	
	Input:
	   - Added Arrow keys to match the AWSD keys and visa versa for the menus.
			( this needed to happen a long time ago )

	   - Fixed the switching from fullscreen to windowed loss of input bug.

	System:
	   - Fixed a bug where if you were in fullscreen, and in openGL mode when you quit the desktop
		had the same resolution as Matrix Attack 640x480. This only happened on win9x.

	   - Finally put an icon into the .exe so now "Matrix Attack.exe" looks like a blue gem.
		

**** VERSION 1.1 ****
	
	Sound and Music:
	   - Rewrote all sound and music code, we are now harnessing the power of fmod.

	   - We can now stream mp3s instead of those long crappy .wav music files we used to have.
	
	Multiplayer:
	   - We removed the multiplayer option. We decided to do this so we can release the game
	      to the public with minimal problems. This was our first attempt at networking and while
	      we DID get it working, its not ready for the public.	
	
	GamePlay:
	   - Tweaked the score so that linkers are worth more.

	   - Made the different cluster sounds occur more often. 
		(ie 6,7,8 gem cluster each have different sounds now)

	   - Rewrote the timer code, so now things are actually based on time. 
		Rather than update counts, ugh. Timed puzzles used to be harder for those who had 
		fast computers...AHAHAH HAH ha... heh.. ok, not that funny.

	   - Got rid of passwords for profiles. Too many people forgot their password...
	     (we still need to get rid of the associated menu buttons )

	Sound:
	   - Changed the volume on a few soundFX. That MAD MAN combo sound was WAY TOO LOUD!!!! heh

	Statistics:
	   - Completely rewrote the stats code and the timer code, thereby fixing all Stats bugs.
	
	Input:
	   - Enter key problem fixed because of new timer code.

	
**** VERSION 1.0 *****

SinglePlayer and MultiPlayer:

     GamePlay:
	- gameplay all round needs evaluated and fixed.
	- combos don't seem to reset sometimes. they used to work... >=/  

     Statistics:
 	- highest combo and linker doesn't get recorded

	- the whole system skips as soon as you look at the stats. (I know this because i had 
		win amp running in the background and it skips exactly the same time when 
		our background tiles skip) side note: I think its because of our timer code. -eli
	- the stats don't seem to FULLY get rid of what the player did when you erase that player...
		(i found this out when you play with a player ... get a high score... then erase.. 
		 then make a new character .. that new character will have the same stats as the first
		 character that was erased)

     Input:
	- custom key settings (right now they are fixed)
	- in openGL our enter key doesn't always work.. (needs to be outside the timer code)
	- when switching from fullscreen to windowed and visa versa we loose input

     Sound:
	- some sounds need to be timed correctly.
	- some sounds need to be made for the higher combos .. 8 on up.
	- all sound volumes need to be tweaked (so one is not louder than the other)

     System:
	- high polygon models have messed up color values (not hard to fix)
	- if your operating system is in 640x480 and you try to start the game WINDOWED you will
	- get a flip DDRAW error. (it is suppose to automatically take you into full screen)

  
     Multiplayer:
	- health subtraction needs to depend on the move done the player
	- names, face icons are both wrong(mixed up) (they used to work...)
	- sometimes gems don't clear when they are suppose to.. (works fine in single player)
	- can't (in game) quit from a multiplayer game... heh who would have thought.
	- multiplayer time trial mode is missing.... (in mp time Trial, health doesn't matter, only points)
	- update "correct" character icons and names (host and client)
	- alignment of player carrots (backside of board)


**** future improvements ****
     Things we would like to add/fix:

	- add 2 player vs. mode. 
	- add a training mode.	
	- add sound f/x and music volume controls.
	- add music track selection controls.
	- add the ability for multiple players on one machine... (either game pad or keyboard)		
	- Lobby chat is great... but what bout chatting with your opponents in-game?
	- end of puzzle mode confirmation.
	- camera effects. 
		(since gems are REALLY 3D we should be able to do a F-ZERO like camera effect on startup)
